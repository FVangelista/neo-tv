## Javascript movie app interface.

Just a simple interface made dynamically with vanilla js, html and css and, also webpack to bundle it up was used.

### About

The point of the project was to play around with Fetch API and create a fully dynamic webapp
with vanilla js. I chose to deploy it with Netlify and use serverless functions to make the api calls with axios.
